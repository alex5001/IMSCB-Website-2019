            <p>The 3rd edition of the IMSCB brings you 2 different categories of hands-on workshops. Regardless of your choice, if you are a PASSIVE Participant to be eligible to get a diploma you need to attend 1 Workshop from each category, 1 Conference and 1 Keynote. On the other hand, ACTIVE Participants must attend only 1 Workshop from each category and 1 Keynote. Because we would like to give all of you the opportunity to broaden your knowledge, each and ever one of you who is interested in a Keynote will have free access, without the need of completing any online form in advance.</p>

                    <p class="event-description">Neonatology is an interesting specialty, but also overwhelming, considering the mixture of emotions that we, humans and doctors, might feel in different situations. Some of these are truly dramatic, and besides a good self-control of emotions, physicians also require excellent medical skills. This hands-on workshop is not addressed only to those passionate about the subject, but to all medical students, because no matter what their chosen specialty is, they can always find themselves in the situation of saving a life - especially one of a child. It’s an excellent opportunity to learn and apply the basic particularities of CPR for newborns, as well as making a comparison with its adult version.</p>
