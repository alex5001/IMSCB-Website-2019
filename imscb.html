                <h1>About IMSCB</h1>
                <p>The International Medical Students&#39; Congress of Bucharest is annually organised by the Medical Student’s Society of Bucharest in December, keeping its tradition. The event dates back to 1997, when it was implemented as a national congress known as &quot;The National Congress of Students and Young Physicians&quot;. Due to the visible interest shown by not only medical students, but also young doctors, after 20 successful editions we decided to take a step further, abroad.</p>

                <p>After 2 decades of updating and reinventing itself, the Congress dissolved the borders and created a long-lasting network over the whole world. Therefore, we are glad to receive registrations from each and every continent, bringing the medical community closer. At the same time, we feel thankful for the opportunity to put Romania on the global medical map, combining in our vast scientific programme excellent Romanian Professors and renowned international speakers.</p>
