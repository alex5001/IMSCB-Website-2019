        <h1>1. Registration</h1>
        <p>In order to register for the third edition of the International Medical Students’ Congress of Bucharest (IMSCB), you need to press the “Register” link and select the type of account that suits you. You can choose from the following: Active Participant, Passive Participant and Not Attending Participant. Based on your choice, you will have to fill in a series of mandatory fields regarding your personal information. We inform you that your personal data is going to be used according to Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR). Your registration will be complete and your status will be confirmed after your payment is validated. </p>
        <h1>2. Types of Participants</h1>
        <h2>a. The Passive Participant</h2>
        <p>This type of account involves participating in the scientific activities of the Congress (conferences, workshops and keynote lectures) and gives access to the social programme, without being an author or a co-author of a scientific paper presented during the IMSCB. Should you like to change your type of account and become an active participant, you may do so until the deadline of abstract submission.</p>
        <h2>b. The Active Participant</h2>
        <p>This type of account involves being an author or a co-author of an accepted scientific paper. The abstract is only going to be submitted by the author, who will also be the presenter. Besides the classical scientific activities (conferences, workshops and keynote lectures), the active participant should also attend the oral presentations. It is mandatory that the author have an active account and all co-authors have an active/not attending account, otherwise their registration will not be valid. Make sure that all of the e-mail addresses are valid. For more information about the scientific papers, please acces the “Abstracts” section from FAQ.</p>
        <h2>c. The Not Attending Participant</h2>
        <p>This type of account does not require your presence at the activities of the Congress, but only your registration as a co-author of a scientific paper. You are not required to deposit the participation fee, but your certificate will be different from that of the active participants. Should you like to change your type of account and become an active participant, you may do so until the deadline of abstract submission. For more information about the scientific papers, please access the “Abstracts” section.</p>
       
     
        <h1>3. Scientific Papers</h1>
        <h2>a. Abstract Categories</h2>
        <p>Your abstract should be submitted into one of the following sections: Fundamental Sciences, Medical Sciences, Surgical Sciences, or Case Report, which you will specify using the dropdown menu “Section”, found on the “Abstracts” page. All of the abstracts submitted into one of the first three above-mentioned categories (Fundamental Sciences, Medical Sciences, Surgical Sciences) must be Original Studies, whereas the abstracts submitted into the Case Report section can involve any medical specialty. Based on your option, you will have to fill in a series of specific mandatory fields. We do not accept Reviews as Scientific Papers in the third edition of the IMSCB.</p>
        <h2>b. Types of Scientific Papers</h2>
        <p>In order to choose the means of presenting your paper, you should select either Powerpoint Presentation, or Poster, in the dropdown field “Type”. </p>
     
     
        <h1>4. Abstract Submission</h1>
        <h2>a. General Rules</h2>
        <p>Each scientific paper (both Powerpoint Presentation and Poster) that you would like to present should have a written abstract. Both the paper and the abstract must be in English. The maximum number of words in an abstract is 350, without taking into consideration the following fields: Title, Author, Co-authors, Scientific Coordinators, Affiliation and Key-words. </p>
       
        <h2>b. Submitting the Abstract</h2>
        <p>Each abstract must only be submitted by the author, who must be an active participant. He will also be responsible of presenting the paper. Only the author can assign the co-authors of a paper by typing their e-mail addresses in the corresponding fields, only after they have succeeded in creating an account for themselves (Active or Not Attending). Make sure that you use exactly the same e-mail addresses when completing the co-author fields, so that the paper can be automatically assigned to their account. One active participant can only submit one abstract and present one paper, but he can be a co-author of an additional paper.  </p>
       
        <h2>c. Presenting the Paper</h2>
        <p>If you have submitted an abstract as an author, but you can no longer participate in the third edition of the International Medical Students’ Congress of Bucharest, please let us know until the 8th of November 2019, by sending an e-mail to either medical.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro, fundamental.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro, casereport.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro, or surgical.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro, according to the category in which you have submitted the abstract. In this case, you should appoint one of the co-authors to present the paper and your account will be modified to Not Attending (your certificate will be modified according to your new status).</p>
        
        <h2>d. Abstract Validation </h2>
        <p>In order to complete the abstract submission, after filling in all of the mandatory fields, you should press the “Submit Abstract” link. At this moment, both the authors and the co-authors should receive an automatic e-mail on the addresses that they used for creating their accounts. This e-mail confirms that we have received your abstract. Please register the abstract only in its final form and following the specific structure, because you will not be able to modify it without our approval. Should your abstract not respect the conditions above, you will be contacted by the organising committee on your e-mail address, which will also allow you to make the necessary changes.  </p>
        <p>We also mention that if two identical abstracts are submitted by two different participants, we will only consider the first one submitted.  </p>
       
        <h2>e. Abstract Details</h2>
        <p>Only standard abbreviations are allowed, but not in the Title field. You should mention them between brackets the first time they are used in your abstract.</p>
        <p>Sources and references will not be mentioned in the abstract. </p>-
        <p>Please take note that papers which have already been presented in other scientific events (Conferences, Congresses etc.), as well as in previous editions of the IMSCB, and published will not be accepted to be presented in the second edition of the IMSCB.</p>
        <p>You are not allowed to use charts, photos or any other image-based materials in the abstract. </p>
        <p>Please make sure that your abstract follows all of the indications above, otherwise it will not be valid. </p>
        <p>The deadline for submitting abstracts is the 13th of October.</p>
        <p>Each paper can have a maximum of 1 author, 3 co-authors and 6 scientific coordinators. </p>
        
        <h1>5. Abstract Selection</h1>
        <h2>a. Evaluating the Abstract</h2>
        <p>All of the submitted abstracts will be evaluated by a board of doctors for each category. Each evaluator will grade the abstracts according to an evaluation form that will be available on the website once we publish the list of accepted abstracts. The abstracts will be ranked by the mean grade of the evaluators and will be published on the website at the beginning of November 2019, in alphabetical order for each category. </p>
        <p>In the event that two or more abstracts receive the same mean grade, the “Conclusion” subsection will be used to establish a hierarchy. </p>
        <p>Should your abstract be accepted, the author and co-authors will receive a confirmation e-mail. </p>
        <h2>b. Participation Scenarios</h2>
        <p>Following this, you will be asked to pay the active participation fee before the 8th of November</p>
        <p>We mention that the fee is non-refundable.</p>
        <p>Should your abstract not be accepted, the author and co-authors will automatically be assigned a passive account and you can confirm your participation by paying the early passive participant fee (for further details, please access the “Fees & Payment” page). In this case, your account will be automatically modified to a passive account.</p>
        <p>One active participant can find himself only in one of the four following situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Author of a paper</li>
            <li>Co-author of a paper</li>
            <li>Author of a paper and Co-author of another paper</li>
            <li>Co-author of two different papers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>6. Oral and Poster Presentation Guidelines</h1>
        <h2>a. General Information</h2>
        <p>After you have elected your options for workshops and conferences (at a date that will be announced 7 days prior on the IMSCB official Facebook page, official website and via e-mail to each participant), you will be assigned:</p>

            <li><strong>passive participants:</strong> 2 mandatory workshops and 1 mandatory conference;</li>
            <li><strong>active participants:</strong> 2 mandatory workshops.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each participant must attend the events they have been assigned to, together with 1 keynote lecture (of their choice) in order to receive their certificate. </p>
        <p>Based on this schedule, we will announce the programme for oral presentations. Please keep in mind that we recommend participating in all of the oral presentations, but we will make sure that none of your mandatory events overlap your oral presentation. </p>
        <h2>b. Tehnical Details</h2>

        <h1>7. Workshops and Conferences Selection</h1>
        <h2>a. Selection Method and Distribution</h2>
        <p>The scientific programme will be completed and published early November, in our attempt to offer a wider range of workshops and conferences. The workshops and conferences selection will be announced 7 days prior, only after the scientific programme is final. </p>
        <p>The link for the workshops and conferences selection will be available in your account for 24 hours and will lead you to a form in which you will have to select, in the order of your preference, a specified number of workshops and conferences. The distribution will be based on the form submission timestamp, your preferences, your year of study and the maximum number of participants in each event. The first assigned events will be the workshops and, for passive participants, the conference will be given so that it does not overlap any of the workshops. </p>
        <p>We would like to remind you that the selection link will only be available to those who have deposited the participation fee before the set deadline. </p>
