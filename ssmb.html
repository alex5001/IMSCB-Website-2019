                <p>Founded on the 13th of January 1875, the Medical Student&#39;s Society of Bucharest (SSMB) is nowadays one of the largest NGOs, representing more than 8000 individuals.</p>
                <p>For decades, the original aim of the organisation has been carefully preserved with numerous new objectives being added.

                <p>Nowadays, the organisation is anchored both nationally and internationally, being included in 2 national federations, as well as the IFMSA (the International Federation of Medical Students’ Associations).
