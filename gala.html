<!--            <h3>Title of this</h3>-->
            <p>Founded in 1952 the Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics was the first of its kind in the whole world. A couple of years after, in 1992 it was named after the amazing professor Ana Aslan. From the first days of existence the main purpose of the institute was to provide medical assistance but also to discover new anti-aging techniques to promote the results worldwide.</p>
            <p>In 1964 the president of the World Health Organization promoted the institute as a model for every country, being the only one that was so advanced in this area. Many research and clinical studies were made throughout the years in the "Ana Aslan" Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics and this is why nowadays it is still a model in this field.</p>
