            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <p>Hoping to facilitate your registration and participation in the IMSCB, we put together a list of answers to questions that often cross our participants’ minds. Scroll down and search for anything that seems unclear and, if you feel like we haven’t answered your question, don’t hesitate to contact us.</p>

            <h1>Registration</h1>
            
            <h3>How can I register?</h3>
            <p>Press the "My Account" link and click "Sign up". Fill in all the required fields and click "Submit". You will receive an activation e-mail on the address which you have used to register. Click on the link in the e-mail and log in on the website using your e-mail address and password.</p>
            
            <h3>What if I change my mind about participating in the IMSCB?</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, all fees are non-refundable. If you deposit the participation fee, we will consider you a participant.</p>
            
            <h3>How do I decide what type of participant I am?</h3>
            <p>There are 3 types of participants: the Active participant is an author/co-author of a scientific paper who will take part in the IMSCB; the Not Attending participant is a co-author of a scientific paper who will NOT take part in the IMSCB; the Passive participant does not have a scientific paper and he/she will take part in the scientific events of the IMSCB.</p>
            
            <h3>What if I change my mind about the type of participant I want to be?</h3>
            <p>If you registered as a passive participant, but decided to submit an abstract after all, click the "Upgrade to active account type" link in your account and follow the instructions. If you registered as a Not Attending participant, but decided to take part in the scientific events as well, click the "Upgrade to active account type" link in your account and follow the instructions. If you registered as an Active participant, but you decide not to submit an abstract, your account will be automatically updated to Passive after the Abstract Submission Deadline. If you registered as an Active participant, but you decide not to take part in the scientific events, you should contact us.</p>
            
            <h3>Do I need to do anything else after I have registered on the website?</h3>
            <p>Once you filled in the required fields and clicked "Submit", you will receive an account activation e-mail. Click on the link in the e-mail and log in on the website using your e-mail address and password. Then, you need to deposit the participation fee and upload the proof of payment in the corresponding field of your account.</p>
            
            <h3>What should I do if I do not receive the account activation e-mail?</h3>
            <p>First, you should click the "Send it again" link which you can find in the “My Account” section. If that doesn't work either, you should contact us.</p>
            
            <h3>What should I do if I forget my account details?</h3>
            <p>If you forgot your password, you should click the "Forgot Password" link in the "My account" section. If you forgot what e-mail address you used to register, you should contact us.</p>
            
            <h3>What should I do if I created 2 or more accounts?</h3>
            <p>We strongly recommend that you should not create more than 1 account, but if you do, you should contact us and say which one of them you would like to keep. Each participant must have exactly one account at the end of the Registration period.</p>
            
            <h3>What should I do if I registered using incorrect information?</h3>
            <p>If you filled in incorrect information, you should check your account details and see if the specific fields are editable or not. If they are, you can correct them yourself. If they are not, you should contact us. In case you wrote an incorrect e-mail address, you will not be able to use your account because you will not receive an activation e-mail. Therefore, in this case you should also contact us.</p>
            
            <h3>Do I need to check in/check out?</h3>
            <p>Both Active and Passive participants must check-in before the first mandatory scientific event. Active participants must also check-out. Passive participants do not have to check-out, since their certificates will be delivered online.</p>
            
            <h3>Do I need to attend the check in personally?</h3>
            <p>Someone else can check you in, but only if they can provide your Identification Document.</p>
            
            <h3>What is the referral code?</h3>
            <p>The referral code is an unique ID belonging to each one of the IMSCB Ambassadors. It is our way of keeping count of how many participants found out about the IMSCB through one of our Ambassadors. It is not a mandatory field, so you should leave it blank if you did not receive one.</p>

            <h1>Accommodation</h1>
            
            <h3>How can I get accommodation?</h3>
            <p>Once we come up with an Accommodation offer, you will be able to choose the Accomodation Package by entering in your account and ticking the Accommodation Package box. The prices will be announced soon.</p>

            <h3>Can I choose who I share the room with?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can! Once you select the "Accommodation" option, you will see a field named "Accommodation buddy", in which you should type in the e-mail address of the participant you want as your roommate. You must type in the e-mail address he/she used when creating an account. After that, he/she will receive an e-mail and will be asked to accept/deny your request. If he/she accepts, the two of you will be paired together in our database.</p>
            
            <h3>What if my roommate changes his/her mind about participating?</h3>
            <p>If the person you were paired with decides that he/she doesn't need Accommodation, one of you should contact us and you will get the chance to choose someone else as your Accommodation buddy. However, if he/she has already deposited the Accommodation fee, he/she will not be able to get a refund.</p>
            
            <h3>What if I change my mind?</h3>
            <p>If you have already been paired with another participant and you decide that you don't need Accommodation, you should contact us and your roommate will get the chance to choose someone else as his/her Accommodation Buddy. However, if you have already deposited the Accommodation fee, you will not be able to get a refund.</p>
            
            <h3>Are meals included in the accommodation package?</h3>
            <p>Lunch is included in all the packages we offer. If you decide to choose the Accommodation package, you will also get breakfast. We do not provide dinner in any of our packages.</p>
            
            <h3>What should I do if I arrive earlier than the opening day or if I plan my departure later than the last day of the congress?</h3>
            <p>We only provide accommodation between the 4th and 8th of December (4 nights). If your stay in Bucharest is longer than that, you must find accommodation for yourself.</p>

            <h1>Scientific Programme</h1>
            
            <h3>When will I know the scientific programme?</h3>
            <p>The scientific programme will be published at the beginning of November. After that, you will have enough time to choose what suits you best before we ask you to fill in your options.</p>
            
            <h3>Do I have to attend all the events in the scientific programme?</h3>
            <p>No, you don't. You must attend the mandatory events you were assigned to (2 workshops and 1 conference for Passive participants and 2 workshops for Active participants), as well as one key-note lecture of your choice, in order to receive your certificate.</p>
            
            <h3>How many events are included in the participation package?</h3>
            <p>Passive participants will be assigned 2 mandatory workshops and 1 mandatory conference. Active participants will be assigned two mandatory workshops. Besides that, both active and passive participants must attend one key-note lecture of their choice and have free access to every other scientific event, based on availability.</p>
            
            <h3>How will I choose what events I want to attend?</h3>
            <p>After we publish the Scientific Programme, a link for scientific events selection will be available in your account for 24 hours. You will be asked to select, in the order of your preference, a specified number of workshops and conferences.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I choose any scientific event?</h3>
            <p>The Scientific Events Selection Form will allow you to choose any scientific event, but we advise you not to choose events which do not match your year of study, because those will not be taken into consideration.</p>
            
            <h3>What should I do if I did not fill in the Scientific Events Selection Form?</h3>
            <p>From the moment it is available in your account, you will be able to fill in the Scientific Events Selection Form in 24 hours. If you fail to do that, you will be automatically assigned to events with available places.</p>
            
            <h3>How will I be assigned to the mandatory events? </h3>
            <p>The criteria we use when assigning participants to scientific events are the following: the timestamp (the sooner you fill in the form, the more chances you have to be assigned to your first option), the order of your preference, your study year (we will check that the event you selected is suitable for your year of study), the time and location of each event (we will make sure that your events do not overlap) and the maximum number of participants for each event. For example, if your first workshop option is suitable for your year of study and there are available places, you will be assigned to it, but if your second option overlaps the first, we will skip it and check your third option.</p>
            
            <h3>When will I know what events I have been assigned to?</h3>
            <p>Once participants have filled in their options for scientific events, we will take between 2 and 3 days to process the list and publish the distribution. If you find that you have been assigned to events which you cannot attend, you must contact us in 48 hours.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I change the events that I have been assigned to?</h3>
            <p>If you cannot participate in one of the mandatory events you have been assigned to, you must e-mail us on scientific.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro in 48 hours starting from the moment the distribution was published. After that, we will not be able to modify the distribution.</p>
            
            <h3>What happens if I cannot participate in one of the events I have been assigned to?</h3>
            <p>If you cannot participate in one of the mandatory events you have been assigned to, you must e-mail us on scientific.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro in 48 hours starting from the moment the distribution was published. After that, we will not be able to modify the distribution.</p>
            
            <h3>Do I have to pay extra to attend scientific events that I have not been assigned to?</h3>
            <p>If you have not been assigned to a scientific event, you can participate in it only if there are free spots, without any extra charge.</p>
            
            <h3>What if I am late for a scientific event? </h3>
            <p>In order to ensure the best outcome of each scientific event, we strongly advise you to arrive at the location at least 10 minutes before the time it is scheduled, because you will not be able to attend if you arrive late.</p>
            
            <h3>Do I have to attend the oral presentations? </h3>
            <p>Participation in the oral presentations is not mandatory, but we advise that participants do so in order to gain more knowledge of the subject they are interested in.</p>
            
            <h3>Do I need any particular equipment for the scientific events? </h3>
            <p>Some scientific events require you to bring your own lab coat/scrubs and, therefore, you need to check the Scientific Events page in advance.</p>
            
            <h3>Do I need to prepare something in advance for the scientific events? </h3>
            <p>Some scientific events may require you to prepare in advance and, therefore, you need to check the Scientific Events page.</p>
            
            <h3>Are there any extra rewards for participating in workshops? </h3>
            <p>Certain workshops are organised as a contest and those will have extra rewards for participants. You can find out which they are on the Scientific Events page.</p>

            <h1>Abstracts</h1>
            
            <h3>When is the deadline for submitting abstracts?</h3>
            <p>The deadline for submitting abstracts will be announced soon.</p>
            
            <h3>Who should submit the abstract?</h3>
            <p>Each abstract must only be submitted by the author, who must be an active participant. He will also be responsible of presenting the paper.</p>
            
            <h3>What are the abstract requirements?</h3>
            <p>All abstracts must be in English. The maximum number of words is 350. Only standard abbreviations are allowed and they must be mentioned between brackets the first time they are used. Sources and references are not required. You must not use charts, photos or any other image-based materials.</p>
            
            <h3>What happens if my abstract does not follow the requirements?</h3>
            <p>If your abstract does not follow the requirements, you will be contacted by the Organising Committee on your e-mail address and you will be asked to make the necessary changes.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I submit my abstract in more than one section? </h3>
            <p>Each abstract can only be submitted in one section, by one participant. In the event that two identical abstracts are submitted, we will only take the first one into consideration.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I submit more than one abstract?</h3>
            <p>Each Active participant can find himself in one of the following situations: Author of a paper/ Co-author of a paper/ Author of a paper and co-author of a different paper/ Co-author of two different papers.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I edit my abstract once I submitted it?</h3>
            <p>Editing your abstract once you submitted it is only possible if the organising committee gives you access to do so. Therefore, should you encounter such issues, we advise you to e-mail <strong>medical.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro</strong>, <strong>fundamental.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro</strong>, <strong>casereport.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro</strong>, or <strong>surgical.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro</strong>, depending on the section in which you submitted your abstract.</p>
            
            <h3>What if I submit an abstract as an author, but I can no longer participate in the Congress?</h3>
            <p>In this case, please let us know as soon as possible, by sending an e-mail to either <strong>medical.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro</strong>, <strong>fundamental.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro</strong>, <strong>casereport.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro</strong>, or <strong>surgical.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro</strong>, according to the category in which you have submitted the abstract. In this case, you should appoint one of the co-authors to present the paper and your account will be modified to Not Attending (your certificate will be modified according to your new status).</p>
            
            <h3>Is it mandatory for the abstract to have one author, 3 co-authors and 6 scientific coordinators?</h3>
            <p>No, it is not. An abstract must have 1 author. The maximum number of co-authors is 3 and the maximum number of scientific coordinators is 6, but the abstract might as well have no co-authors and no scientific coordinators.</p>
            
            <h3>How do I choose the co-authors of the abstract?</h3>
            <p>After you click "Add new abstract" in your account, you will be asked to type in the e-mail addresses of the co-authors. This means that all co-authors must have a valid Active/Not Attending account when you submit the abstract.</p>
            
            <h3>Must the co-authors participate in the Congress?</h3>
            <p>Co-authors can either be Active participants (which involves their participation in the scientific events), or Not Attending participants (who do not have to participate in the Congress).</p>
            
            <h3>Must the scientific coordinators participate in the Congress?</h3>
            <p>No, scientific coordinators are not required to participate in the Congress.</p>
            
            <h3>When can I find out if my abstract was accepted?</h3>
            <p>We will publish the Accepted Abstracts list at the beginning of November, in alphabetical order for each section, on the website.</p>
            
            <h3>Who evaluates my abstract?</h3>
            <p>Abstracts in each category will be evaluated by a board of doctors. The organising committee does not evaluate or choose accepted abstracts in any way.</p>
            
            <h3>What criteria are used to evaluate abstracts?</h3>
            <p>Each evaluator will grade the abstract according to an evaluation form which will be available on the website together with the Accepted Abstracts List.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I ask for my abstract to be re-evaluated?</h3>
            <p>Once the Accepted Abstract List is published, you can e-mail <strong>medical.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro</strong>, <strong>fundamental.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro</strong>, <strong>casereport.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro</strong>, or <strong>surgical.imscb@ssmbucharest.ro</strong>, depending on the section in which you submitted your abstract, and ask to see the grades your abstract received from the evaluators.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I ask for another abstract to be re-evaluated?</h3>
            <p>No, you cannot ask for information about abstracts which do not belong to you.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I modify the co-authors after the abstract has been accepted? </h3>
            <p>Once the Accepted Abstract List is published, you can no longer modify anything in your abstract.</p>
            
            <h3>What should I do next if my abstract was accepted?</h3>
            <p>In this case, you have 10 days since we publish the Accepted Abstracts list to pay the Active participation fee (45 Euro) and upload the proof of payment in your account.</p>
            
            <h3>What should I do next if my abstract was not accepted?</h3>
            <p>In this case, your account will automatically become a Passive account. You have 10 days since we publish the Accepted Abstracts list to deposit the Early Participation fee and upload the proof of payment in your account.</p>
