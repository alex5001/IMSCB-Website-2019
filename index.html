                <p class="story-excerpt">This year, every IMSCB participant will get the chance to participate in 2 exquisite workshops of their choice! Once the scientific programme is final, you will be asked to choose 1 workshop included in the First Category and 1 workshop included in the Second Category. What’s the difference?</p>
                <p>The First Category includes hands-on workshops, which will allow participants to practice different procedures themselves, as shown by instructors. They will give you the opportunity to develop surgical skills, discover laboratory techniques and master clinical procedures.</p>
                <p>The Second Category includes workshops which focus on training participants’ logic, in an attempt to consolidate their previous knowledge and provide additional medical information. Participating in one of these workshops will surely improve your diagnostic skills in whichever specialty you choose.</p>
                <p>Stay tuned to discover what we have in store!</p>

                <p class="story-excerpt">Last year, the most courageous participants had the amazing opportunity to publish their extraordinary works in a well-known scientific journal. The Congress offered the chance for the best abstracts to become part of the International Journal of Medical Students (IJMS), not only ensuring them visibility in the medical world, but also transforming their authors into valuable publishers.</p>
                <p>This year, we are glad to announce that the selected abstracts will once again become available for all the readers of the scientific journal mentioned above. We genuinely encourage you to take this unique chance and enjoy the additional advantages of submitting your original work.</p>
                <p>You can check last year's selected abstracts by clicking below.</p>

                <p class="story-excerpt">1918 is a very important and meaningful year for Romania, being the year when the Unification of the Romanian Principalities was possible.</p>
                <p>2018 is when we remember and praise the faith, effort, strong will and ambition of our predecessors, those national heroes who sacrificed their lives for their purpose to happen. Their values and beliefs were noble and necessary for the existence of the Romanian country we know today. Together we celebrate their bravery and our existence by remembering their actions and appreciating the international support they were given. 1918 is the year when an international community was built, an international community we are all part of today.</p>
                <p>The International Medical Students’ Congress of Bucharest joins and supports the national movement to celebrate the Centenary in an attempt to honor the values we, as a country, have gained in these hundred years.</p>
