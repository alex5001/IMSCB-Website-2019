                <h1>About Ana Aslan </h1>
                <p>Every year we name our editions to honor some of the most important medical personalities in Romanian medicine. They inspire us, as they stood by their values as we stand by ours, and they’ve given to the world so much information that they had a saying in what today’s medicine looks like. We’ve had the George Emil Palade edition, the Victor Babeș edition and now it is time to pay our respect to another Romanian pioneer: Ana Aslan. She lived in a hostile world, under the communist regime, but her name found glory. She created an empire under these harsh conditions and became a role model to women all over the world. </p>

                <h1>About Ana Aslan </h1>
                <p>Ana Aslan was born in Brăila, Romania, on the 1st of January 1897. When she was 13, her father, whom she was very close to, passed away and her family moved to Bucharest. The premature death of her father determined her, five years later, to go on hunger strike to prove her will to become a physician, saying: “I choose to fight for life because I hate death with all my heart.” She graduated from the Faculty of Medicine in 1922 and obtained her M.D. degree in 1924, with a thesis on cardiovascular physiology. Later on she became a professor and she was named the director of an Elderly Nursing Home. </p>

                <h1>About Ana Aslan </h1>
                <p>In 1952 she began studies on the aging process, turning the Elderly Home into a research institute. This way she founded the National Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics. Her experimental studies showed good resuts using procaine in patients with arthritis, also improving their well-being, memory, skin, hair and immunity. After a three-year study she finally marketed Gerovital, the so called Fountain of youth. After more studies, she developed an improved formula, Aslavital, a product that has quickly become an industry and it’s still being produced at the moment.The 60s were glorious for Ana Aslan, as her miracle product was being sold worldwide, with incomes of 17 million dollars a year. Her name and the Institute she was leading became almost more internationally recognised than Ceaușescu himself. Politicians and celebrities all around the globe were using her new drug, ingluding John F. Kennedy. Claudia Cardinale, Salvador Dali and Charlie Chaplin all came to Bucharest to be treated by Professor Ana Aslan.

                <p>Her legacy is more actual than ever, her anti-aging product, Aslavital, is still produced at the National Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics that Ana Aslan founded. She was a world renowed scientist, professor and doctor. She was a powerful woman, beloved leader and trusted therapist.
