                <h1>About Victor Babeș</h1>
                <p>Victor Babeș was a Romanian physician, bacteriologist, academician and professor. As one of the founders of modern microbiology, Babeș, in collaboration with French scientist V. A. Cornil, wrote „Bacteria and their role in pathological anatomy and histology of infectious diseases” – one of the first treaties of bacteriology in the world.</p>
                <p>The death of his sister, caused by tuberculosis, had a huge impact on the scientist. Babeș, who was studying at the Institute of Dramatic Art in Budapest at that time, promised that he would do everything he could to help the sick and enrolled at the Faculty of Medicine in Vienna.</p>

                <h1>About Victor Babeș</h1>
                <p>His scientific career began as an assistant in the Pathological Anatomy laboratory in Budapest, position he held between 1874 and 1881. In 1885, he was appointed professor of histopathology at the Faculty of Medicine in Budapest. In that same year, he discovered a parasitic sporozoan, named Babeșia in his honour. His scientific achievements were vast, having discovered 50 new types of microbes, while proving that certain groups of microbes were responsible of the most frequent diseases of his time. Babeș was the first to find the tuberculous bacilli in the urine of infected patients. He also discovered specific cellular inclusions in rabies-infected neurons.</p>

                <h1>About Victor Babeș</h1>
                <p>In 1887, Babeș returned to Romania and was appointed professor of pathological anatomy and bacteriology at the Faculty of Medicine in Bucharest. In 1900, he founded the Anatomic Society of Bucharest, which dealt with anatomical clinical studies. Thirteen years later, he worked on a cholera vaccine to combat the epidemic that broke out among the Romanian Army during the Second Balkan War in Bulgaria. In 1919, he was appointed professor at the University of Cluj, newly founded that same year.</p>
                <p>Victor Babeș introduced rabies vaccination in Romania, thus being considered the father of serotherapy. He also prepared the anti-diphtheria serum and conducted broad activity in researching pellagra, tuberculosis, typhoid fever and leprosy.</p>
