            <p class="key-short-description">Each and every proffesional makes his own choice in regard to working in a certain environment, taking into consideration the risks and the advantages that come with the job. Medicine however is not only a „job” , but also a way of life and coming to terms with the safety issues that it may comprise can be a bit demanding. This keynote conference aims to bring structure to various kinds of factors that could interfere with the medical care being given in optimum conditions, due to possible diseases that the medical personelle could get in contact with.</p>

            <h3>Speaker Biography</h3>
            <p>Domenico Doria is Senior Research at ELI Nuclear Physics – IFIN in Magurele, Romania. After he studied in Italy (Laurea in Physics at Salento University, and INFN member), he obtained a PhD in Plasma Physics and Applied Electronics at Salento University in 2006. His research interests lay in the area of intense laser-plasma interactions, with particular expertise in laser-driven acceleration of ion beams. He has been involved in Italian national INFN (National Institute for Nuclear Physics) projects such as PLAIA (Plasma Laser Ablation for Ion Acceleration) and during his PhD studies he has been awarded with a Marie Curie Fellowship at DCU (Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland), where he carried out plasma VIS–UVU spectroscopy of laser ion sources. He has been involved in the UK-wide EPSRC project such as LIBRA (Basic Technology, 2007-12) and recently in the European multimillion project ELI (Extreme Light Infrastructure, from 2013), and A-SAIL (Programme Grant, from 2013), aimed to the advancement of laser-ion acceleration towards future medical applications. D.D is a frequent user of the Central Laser Facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, and, as a member of QUB Centre for Plasma Physics, has contributed to developing the TARANIS laser facility in Belfast. He is the author or coauthor of more than 80 publications on peer-reviewed journals (with a total of about 1000 citations and a h-index 18 to date, ISI data) including 2 Nature Communications and 8 Physical Review Letters.</p>

        <h3>About this keynote</h3>
        <p>Lasers are already used in medicine since decades and they have brought a great progress in medical diagnosis, treatments, or therapies. The laser in Magurele, ELI-NP (Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics), is, for instance, thousand of million of millions times more powerful than a typical surgical CO2 laser. Of course this laser light is not shot directly on living beings, but against matter; and it is the products of this interaction that are then used for various purposes and applications.</p>
        <p>The ELI laser will be the most powerful laser in the world and it will be used to make unprecedented research and discoveries; and all this will happen in Romania.</p>
        <p>My talk will give the audience an overview of the ELI facility and the possibilities this system can open up in fundamental research and in medical applications in particular.</p>
