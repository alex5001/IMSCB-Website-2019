            <span class="speaker">Prof. Fabio Santanelli di Pompeo MD, PhD</span>
            <p class="key-short-description">Gender dysphoria emerged as a term designated to define the situation of a patient that doesn’t recognize his assigned gender to be his identity gender.  Plastic surgeons often deal with patients experiencing gender dysphoria that require sex reassignment surgery. However, facing life threatening afflictions, such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma and other pathologies emerging from this subject, it is our duty as doctors to find ways to do prophylaxis as well as find the best way to treat already established disorders, affecting the patient as little as possible.</p>

            <p class="key-short-description">Anti-aging functional foods exert their influence mostly through their anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Nutraceuticals are oral dietary components naturally found in foods and believed to have a medical or health benefit. Replacement of the micronutrient deficiencies, as well as high-dose therapy of selected nutraceuticals in combination with an optimal diet,  can prevent not only aging but also chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease and stroke.</p>
