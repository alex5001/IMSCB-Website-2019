Nutraceuticals are oral dietary components naturally found in foods and believed to have a medical or health benefit. Replacement of the micronutrient deficiencies, as well as high-dose therapy of selected nutraceuticals in combination with an optimal diet, can prevent not only aging but also chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease and stroke."
