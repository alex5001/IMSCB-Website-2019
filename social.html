                <p>The National History Museum of Romania, founded in 1972, stands as one of the emblematic institutions of Romanian culture. Housed in a historic building formerly known as “The Post Palace”, the museum is located in the old city center of Bucharest. The building was designed by architect Alexandru Săvulescu (1847-1902), who drew inspiration from the Federal Post Palace in Geneva, and later erected between 1894 and 1899.</p>

                <p>The Cotroceni National Museum is housed in the old Royal Palace, built in 1895, which stands apart as an truly unique site, due to the intertwinement between a location of great historical significance, with a history spanning 350 years, and an art museum. The focus of the museum is not the value of its various artefacts, but rather the connection its halls and apartments have had with the people who have lived there over the centuries.</p>
