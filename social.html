            <h1>Social Programme</h1>
            <p>Our team has constantly worked on a special Social Programme that will complete the wonderful experience you will have at IMSCB. Multiculturality and communication are 2 of the values around which we sketch the whole concept of the Congress. As a result, we have created both a Daytime and Night-time Programme, that include a variety of activities which will provide you an authentic Romanian experience and even more. Be part of this beautiful journey that awaits you! </p>
