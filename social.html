               <h3><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/sQ1H5rTCScL2">Open in GoogleMaps</a></h3>
               <p>Victor Babeş is one of the most renowned pioneers of the Romanian medical science of the 19th century, with significant contributions to the field of bacteriology and involvement in research concerning diseases such as rabies, leprosy, diphtheria and tuberculosis. As founder of the National Pathology and Bacteriology Institute and a teacher of pathological anatomy at the University of Bucharest, he was described by Gheorghe Marinescu, one of his students who later became a famed neurologist, as the most illustrious representative or Romanian medical science. </p>
               <p>The museum that bears his name today was founded by his son, Mircea Babeş, in memory of the scientist’s great contributions to the world of medicine. Mircea gathered his father’s belongings from the apartment that Victor Babeş used in the National Pathology and Bacteriology Institute and , with them, created an exhibition on the ground floor of a house that he donated to the Bucharest City Hall. The house itself was designed in the eclectic style of the 1920s and built in the northern part of the city, in a quiet neighbourhood, initially in order to be used as a private residence, but today housing a collection consisting mostly of Victor Babeş's scientific work.</p>

                <p>The National History Museum of Romania, founded in 1972, stands as one of the emblematic institutions of Romanian culture. Housed in a historic building formerly known as “The Post Palace”, the museum is located in the old city center of Bucharest. The building was designed by architect Alexandru Săvulescu (1847-1902), who drew inspiration from the Federal Post Palace in Geneva, and later erected between 1894 and 1899.</p>

                <p>The Cotroceni National Museum is housed in the old Royal Palace, built in 1895, which stands apart as an truly unique site, due to the intertwinement between a location of great historical significance, with a history spanning 350 years, and an art museum.
